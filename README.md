### About 
Welcome to my data science portfolio! Each of these projects were done through my completed Master of Science in Data Science at Bellevue University using real world data. The research analysis was heavily and thoroughly explore through the dataset where it provides critical insights to these problems.  You can take look at the solutions of my deep data analysis on how I went through the process and arriving to my consensus conclusions.

### Work/Projects 
<br>

[Childcare Affordability](https://github.com/dandoan0201/Dan-Doan-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Childcare_Affordability.ipynb) <br>
This project looks at the childcare affordability in the United States using the data from the 
National Database of Child Care Prices (NDCP). This deep dive analysis looks at whether the prices 
for childcare in particularity in Washington are considered to be affordable or not. This provides 
great insights and information for families across all regions and aboard tailor to their childcare 
options needs.

[Airlines Aircrafts Fleet](https://github.com/dandoan0201/Dan-Doan-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Airlines_Aircrafts_Fleet%20.ipynb) <br>
This project looks at all airlines across the airline industry and their respective aircrafts’ fleets 
that they own.  This is a research analysis to look for areas where airline companies can cut costs on 
other areas other than fuel consumption. This gives great insights for investors who are interested in 
the airline industry as a whole.  


<br>

[Employee Job Satisfaction](https://github.com/dandoan0201/Dan-Doan-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Employee_Job_Satisfaction.ipynb) <br>
This project was a research analysis on job satisfaction and how it was being measured across various factors. This provide greater clarity and 
understanding of overall employee turnover rate and their effects. 

<br>

[Labor Market within Tech Sector](https://github.com/dandoan0201/Dan-Doan-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Labor_Market_within_Tech_Sector.ipynb) <br>
This project was a research analysis on labor market in general, however, within the technology sector. This provide insight on whether the jobs
that are avaliable and what's currently employed considered to be fair. 

<br>

[Netflix Viewership](https://github.com/dandoan0201/Dan-Doan-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Netflix_Viewership.ipynb) <br>
This research analysis was about finding the context behind Netflix top 10 viewership and popularity. This was a interesting find to the discrepancy between
films and tv whether it was spoken in the language of English or not. 

<br>

[TSA Complaints](https://github.com/dandoan0201/Dan-Doan-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/TSA_Complaints.ipynb) <br>
This research consist of finding the context behind the use of power within the TSA agency in regards to the complaints that were filed. It is to determine 
on whether increase of security violate people rights rather than protecting passengers prior to boarding on their flights. 

<br>

[Titanic Model Building Project](https://github.com/dandoan0201/Dan-Doan-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Titanic%20Model%20Building%20Project%20Sample.ipynb) <br>
This was an interesting exercise on the study of the perished indiviuals who lives wasn't able to be saved. The dataset among the research analysis gave
a slice on what had occurred during the event when the Titantic ship got sunked. 

<br>

[White House Visitor Logs](https://github.com/dandoan0201/Dan-Doan-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/White_House_Visitor_Logs.ipynb) <br>
This research analysis was about the snapshot on what goes around within the White House. It provides greater transparency and context behind the scene
on who visit the Presideent of the United States.
